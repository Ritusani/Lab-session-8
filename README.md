# LAB-SESSION-8
# MSIS at Santa Clara University
## Introduction:
The aim of this lab session is to redesign a previously done **LAB SESSION 5** and _**critique**_ it. The work was to build a fact sheet for MSIS at Santa Clara university. 

With the steep increase in the enrollment trend for graduate studies many people opt for completing their Master’s degree. The main question that comes to student’s mind is what majors to pursue? Which degree has the greatest return of investment? Which degree guarantees a job? With the recent trends, a Master’s degree in Information System (MSIS) is the degree to watch out for. The perfect blend of business and technology gives the degree a competitive edge in the market. Now, the next big questions is which university should be chosen for MSIS? 
To make it easier for the prospective students, I have done some analysis and my fact sheet could help in answering the questions mentioned above.

## Claim:
Pursuing Masters in Information Systems (MSIS) from Santa Clara University is a wise choice in terms of academics, job opportunities & return of Investment. 
I am going to prove the above mentioned claim by answering the following questions – 
1.	Why MSIS?
2.	Why at SCU?


## Critique on Previous Lab session:
The purpose of any visualization holds the key to a better visualization, more clear the purpose better the visualization. This particular lab session was aimed at showing the audience as to how MSIS as a graduate degree is better than other graduate courses and moreover if done from Santa Clara University. Considering the importance of purpose in any visualization elaborating the purpose of this assignment would be the ideal criteria for critiquing it.

### Any visualization’s purpose can be divided into 3 parts depending on the criteria – **

**1.	Type of Information –**

First question to be asked is, what type of information is being depicted by the visualization? It can either be Conceptual information whose focus is on ideas and purpose is to teach its audience or the type of information could be Data-Driven, where the main focus is on statistical data and the purpose is to inform its audience.

 It is clear from the definition that the type of information depicted by the visualization in this assignment is Data-driven as the audiences are being informed about how doing MSIS at Santa Clara University is a good choice.
 
 **2. Audience -**
 
 Considering the specific audience is the next most important thing to do. The Audience of this fact sheet are prospective students who are willing to join the university and pursue a MSIS degree. Now as we know the audience, we to address their: 
 
		•	Needs
		
		•	Wants
		
		•	Fears

_**Need:**_

The prospective students need to take a decision on which university and which major they should enroll in. In most cases, Masters is done for advancements in the career. Hence, the need for the prospective students is to research accordingly and find something which perfectly aligns with their career choices. 

_**Fears:**_

		♣	 getting a job?
		♣	 return on investment?
		♣	 Long term growth in careers? 
		♣	 Advancement in careers?
		♣	 Good pay packages?


**2.	Aim of Visualization –**

Lastly, we focus on what is the main aim of the visualization? Is it to explore data to get new findings or to declare and support a particular statement. Hence, the aim of this fact sheet is to **declare and support** that doing MSIS at Santa Clara University is definitely a good investment.

## Critique on individual visualizations 
 
					**Previous Fact sheet Looked like this**

_**Previous Metrics:**_ 

### WHY MSIS ? 

_**1. Comparison of average salaries of various majors:**_

In this Visualization, I am showing average salaries of various majors in comparison to MSIS. As shown below, MSIS is ranked second among all other majors. The average salary of a person holding MSIS degree is higher than most majors. 

**Critique** Though, this visualization is shows a clear comparison, it could have been depicted in a better way, with just two bars - one for other majors and one for MSIS, as extra informatio for all other majors wasn't needed. 

					**Old visualization**

_**2. Unemployment to Employment ratio for Various Majors:**_

This visualization shows the employed vs unemployed ratio for each of the majors. The stacked bar chart clearly depicts that this ratio for people holding MSIS degrees is very low, showing that there are more employed candidates than unemployed candidates. 

**Critique** This visualization is ambiguous in nature. The Exact number of employed and unemployed individual needs to be calculated separately. Side-by-side bars should have been used instead of stacked bar to show the claim more clearly.

_**3. Unemployment rates of various majors:

This metrics depicts the rate at which people holding various degrees lose their jobs and get unemployed. Therefore, lower the unemployment rate – higher the job security.

**Critique**
Firstly, unemplyment rate or any other kind of rate comparisons are best if shown with time. Since, this unemployment rate doesnt show a trend with time, its not impactful. 

Secondly, Gantt chart is used to show the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate of MIS being the least it is placed at the end of the list which gives out a wrong message. The inverse of this would mean that MIS has greater employment rate, which, if visualized, will place MIS in the second place, depicting a clearer claim. Also, Using Gantt chart wouldn’t have been the most appropriate idiom for this visualization. A trend line could have done a better job.

### WHY SCU ?

_**4. Location of SCU:**_

While choosing any university the location plays a very important role. Depending on the majors of study, different factors are to be taken into consideration while choosing the appropriate location. 

The number of IT firms in a state represent the amount of job opportunities in that state. (I am taking the count of IT firms as majority of MSIS related jobs are created through IT firms). 

In this visualization, the states are colored based on the number of firms. California having the largest number of IT firms is colored the darkest shade and Florida with the least number is colored the lightest shade. Also, the states are labeled with average salaries of MSIS related job roles and it’s pretty clear that California has the highest average salary as well. 

**Critique**
Comparison of all the states is of no use, rather showing just the cities of California would make better sense. In fact just the cities creating jobs in the Santa clara County would have been a much stronger visualization to support the claim.

				**Attemp at Improving Visualization**
				
<img width="719" alt="screen shot 2017-11-11 at 12 21 07 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32205588/32687666-647bc9c6-c676-11e7-89c5-93e9500a427c.png">

_**5. Average Early and Mid-career salaries of candidates holding master’s degree from various Universities:**_

This visualization shows the salaries offered to a graduate student of various universities, after gaining their master’s degree, we find that Santa Clara University graduates have considerably high early and mid-career salaries. 

The salary offered to SCU graduates is comparable to the salary offered to graduates from universities like Stanford. There is huge hike in the mid-career salary from the early career salary of a SCU graduate.

**Critique** Showing all the universities, including universities like Stanford weakens the argument and sums up to unnecessary data on the chart. It violates the data-pixel rule. Hence, having just two numbers on the graph would be a better option - one for the average early and mid-career salary of all the other universities and one for Santa Clara University. Depicting the data this way would enforcethe argument more strongly.

## Framework for redesigning:

I simply followed the framework taught in the class. Taking this course gave me a total different perspective and approach of how to go about for building a visualization. There are various steps involved in the process of building a visualization. Below are the steps which guided me to redesign the visualization:

_**1. Audience:**_ Understand the audience and try to address all of their concerns, fears, wants and needs. 

**My audience** for this are prospective students willing to join MSIS at Santa Clara University.

_**2. Data:**_ Look for data acoordingly or Understanding the data and the context of the data accordingly, which in turn helps in understanding the audience better. As some aspects of the might not be useful to the audience hence those aspects should not be used. 

_**3. Argument or claim:**_ Make a very specific argument using the data that you have. Vague aarguments can be weakened easily, which is not desirable.  

**My claim** is Pursuing Masters in Information Systems (MSIS) from Santa Clara University is a wise choice in terms of academics, job opportunities & return of Investment. 

_**4. Metrics:**_ Choose metrics to support the claim, like -

**My metrics** are Average early and mid-career salaries of SCU Alumini, Unemployment to employment ratio for different graduate courses, Unemployment rate, Average salaries of different majors, Location etc. 

These are the facts which when used with the context of teh argument - actually help in supporting the claim. Finding appropriate metrics is very important. There can be lot of **alternative metrics** available, so **Selecting** one which fits perfectly with the argument is important. 

_**5. Visualization:**_ Put the data on charts and choose charts considering the audience. More Simple - the better. Keeping in mind the data-pixel ratio and not doing data vomit is a must. This is the final step of the framework. 

## Conclusion:

It is very easy to identify the extreme difference between the previous visualization and the redesigned visualization. It is undeniable that to get the right visualization following a particular framework helps a lot. Without a framework, it is near to impossible to cover all different aspects of the visualization which distorts the purpose of Data Visualization. 

## Data Sources:
I used multiple data sets for making the fact sheet. I have mentioned all the data sources below - (Some data sets were extracted using beautiful soup and others were webscrapped. Some were direct excel files that could be downloaded)
